An attempt to rewrite Inochi2D reference implementation to LuaJIT to be used in [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org) environment.

Rewrite is based on commit [Inochi2D/inochi2d@1139fba](https://github.com/Inochi2D/inochi2d/commit/1139fba838174f78dec8460092c4458c98e5ef4a), but will be updated in case an update follows.
